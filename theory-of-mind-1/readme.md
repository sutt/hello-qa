# Theory of Mind:

Problems inspired from Michal Kosinski, "Theory of Mind May Have Spontaneously Emerged in Large Language Models" (https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.02083).

Since this paper focus more  on gpt-3 and lower levels fro this task, we do not see any compelling differences between gpt-3.5 and gpt-4 here.

Several of the questions and procedure are suboptimal:
 - there are logprobs used in the paper but not here
 - some of the questions, when read in isolation are not anambiguously answerable. suggest possibly removing those.
